Struggles: Figuring out how to only map user posts, had a hard time 
figuring out regex, getting all components to load, lots and lots of cors issues

Wins: Figured out all of my struggles

Things I learned: Setting up user authentication 
In react, more use cases for turnary statements,
How to use context, how to load multiple components,
